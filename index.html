    <h3>About Java</h3>
    <p>
      Java refers to a number of computer software products and specifications from Sun Microsystems
      (the Javaâ„¢ technology) that together provide a system for developing and deploying cross-platform
      applications. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms spanning from embedded devices
      and mobile phones on the low end to enterprise servers and super computers on the high end. Java
      is fairly ubiquitous in mobile phones, Web servers and enterprise applications, and somewhat less
      common in desktop applications, though users may have come across Java applets when browsing
      the Web.
      Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed
      as Java bytecode, though there are compilers available for other languages such as JavaScript,
      Python and Ruby, and a native Java scripting language called Groovy. Java syntax borrows heavily
      from C and C++ but it eliminates certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple
      memory model where every object is allocated on the heap and all variables of object types are
      references. Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection
      performed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

    <h3>OOP Concecpt</h3>
    <p>
      OOP is a particular style of programming which involves a particular way of designing solutions to
      particular problems. Most modern programming languages, including Java, support this paradigm.
      When speaking about OOP one has to mention:
      1. Inheritance
      2. Modularity
      3. Polymorphism
      4. Encapsulation (binding code and its data)
      However at this point it is too early to try to fully understand these concepts.
      This guide is divided into two major sections, the first section is an introduction to the language and
      illustrates various examples of code while the second part goes into more detail.
