    <h3>About Java</h3>
    <p>
      Java refers to a number of computer software products and specifications from Sun Microsystems
      (the Javaâ„¢ technology) that together provide a system for developing and deploying cross-platform
      applications. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms spanning from embedded devices
      and mobile phones on the low end to enterprise servers and super computers on the high end. Java
      is fairly ubiquitous in mobile phones, Web servers and enterprise applications, and somewhat less
      common in desktop applications, though users may have come across Java applets when browsing
      the Web.
      Writing in the Java programming language is the primary way to produce code that will be deployed
      as Java bytecode, though there are compilers available for other languages such as JavaScript,
      Python and Ruby, and a native Java scripting language called Groovy. Java syntax borrows heavily
      from C and C++ but it eliminates certain low-level constructs such as pointers and has a very simple
      memory model where every object is allocated on the heap and all variables of object types are
      references. Memory management is handled through integrated automatic garbage collection
      performed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
